Revision history for Perl extension File::SAUCE.

0.03  Sun Aug 10 2003
	- comment lines are auto-trucated when comments are set
	- comment data is now an array ref even when no comments are available.
	- as_string method created (used by all _write* subs)
	- internal sub _write_raw_data() now explicitly returns the data
	- _write_raw_data() also auto-fixes file size
	- SAUCE_ID and COMNT_ID are now exported.
	- has_sauce() sub added. You can now check SAUCE existance by
	  doing: if ( $ansi->has_sauce  ) { ... }
	- auto_date() sub added. It will auto-set the date in the sauce record
	  (unless it already exists). Calling it with no args uses the current
	  date. Note: this is auto-called before a write()
	- convert_localtime() sub added. it takes a localtime-able value and
	  turns it into a suitable SAUCE record date (uses time() if arg is
	  omitted)

	Interface overhaul:
	- Removed the need to specify a filename on new()
	- You can specify nothing, a filename, a ref to a filehandle or raw data
	  for new()
	- read(), write(), and remove() now require either a filename, a ref
	  to a filehandle, or raw data to work
	- when using raw data, you must set the $is_raw_data flag to true
	  ex: $ansi->read($data, 1);
	- get_id(), still gets the SAUCE ID, but you can now use get_sauce_id()
	  and get_comnt_id() to get either ID.
	- clear() now sets all elements to '', rather than the last version's
	  defaults
	- by changing to the above you can check to see if a file has a SAUCE
	  record by checking the return of get_sauce_id() (eq 'SAUCE' -> yes,
	  else -> no)
