File::SAUCE - A library to manipulate SAUCE metadata

SAUCE stands for Standard Architecture for Universal Comment Extentions. It is used as metadata
to describe the file to which it is associated. It's most common use has been with the ANSI and
ASCII "art scene."


WARNING

From the SAUCE documenation:

SAUCE was initially created for supporting only the ANSi & RIP screens. Since both ANSi
and RIP are in effect text-based and have no other form of control but the End-Of-File marker,
SAUCE should never interfere with the workings of a program using either ANSi or RIP. If it
does, the program is not functionning the way it should. This is NOT true for the other types
of files however. Adding SAUCE to some of the other filetypes supported in the SAUCE
specifications may have serious consequences on the proper functionning of programs using those
files, In the worst case, they'll simply refuse the file, stating it is invalid. 

The author(s) of this software take no resposibility for loss of data!
